# **BlueCat Gateway**


## Example folder

The Example folder contains **Certified Example Workflows** developed and tested by BlueCat. These Certified Example Workflows demonstrate the kinds of workflows that can be built for BlueCat Gateway, as well as BlueCat's best practices for Python development, UI components, and API usage.

Each release of BlueCat Gateway has a corresponding tag that can be used to download the version that is guaranteed to be compatible with that release. New customers less familiar with GitHub can also import the Example workflows directly from the BlueCat Gateway user interface (Internet connection required).
