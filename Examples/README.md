# **BlueCat Gateway**


## RESTRUCTURE ANNOUNCEMENT: Examples folder

BlueCat will be restructuring the Examples folder. **All content within the Examples folder will moved to the Certified folder with the next release of BlueCat Gateway**. The impact of this change will be that any customers on BlueCat Gateway v19.5.1 and earlier might not be able to import Example workflows when performing GitHub Import, or the import operation will exit with an error in the log files. **BlueCat advises all customers on versions 19.5.1 and earlier to upgrade to the latest BlueCat Gateway version in order to maintain operation of the GitHub Import functionality**.

The Examples folder contains **Example Workflows** maintained by BlueCat and extensively tested. These Example Workflows demonstrate the power and flexibility of BlueCat Gateway and contains some of the best practices when creating your own workflow. These workflows are purely example and are not meant to be directly used in production.
 
Each release of BlueCat Gateway has a corresponding tag that can be used to download the version that is guaranteed to be compatible with that release. New customers less familiar with GitHub can also import the Example workflows directly from the BlueCat Gateway user interface (Internet connection required).
