# **BlueCat Gateway**


## Examples folder

The Examples folder contains **Example Workflows** maintained by BlueCat and extensively tested. These Example Workflows demonstrate the power and flexibility of BlueCat Gateway and contains some of the best practices when creating your own workflow. These workflows are purely example and are not meant to be directly used in production.
 
Each release of BlueCat Gateway has a corresponding tag that can be used to download the version that is guaranteed to be compatible with that release. New customers less familiar with GitHub can also import the Example workflows directly from the BlueCat Gateway user interface (Internet connection required).
